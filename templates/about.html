           The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's
           interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the
           Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his
           travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning
           were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and
           stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky
           number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their
           party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King[1], was the son of
                Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli.
                Thorin was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the
                Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of
                Five Armies.

                Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
                company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.</p>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
                Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel than the rest
                of Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
                Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
                others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <p>Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship
